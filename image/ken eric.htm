          is difficult to get non-standard size passport photos taken in the USA. 
          Unless you specifically ask for, most stores will print 2x2 inch US 
          Passport photos for you. However with Online Passport photos, you can 
          easily order passport photos for South African Passport, 8 Passport 
          Photos for $7.95, delivered directly to your home. Note: You can also 
          get them usually within 24 hours by either selecting an option to pick 
          at your local Walgreens store or by asking us to e-mail passport photos 
          in a 4x6 print format that you can take to any photo lab or store and 
       get printed yourself. </p>

            US specifications. </p>
