This project is designed to develop a library system which is meant to replace mainly most of the 
manual activities being carried out by user in Library. The purpose of 
implementing such system is to meet the needs of patrons and librarian for such a system. The 
main objectives of this project are for patron to be able to check-in and checkout books and other 
material from the library on their own, the patron can use the search function to view catalog of 
other affiliated library in other for librarian to make request on their behalf. The patron can also 
make request for books to be reserved for them with this library system. And for librarian, they 
can manage catalog in the library. they can as well register patron with this system and accept 
payment in form of fines from patrons. When the system is being setup it will cause userâ€™s data 
to be more security, it makes check-in and checkout of books to be less tedious and time 
consuming, it give patrons unlimited choices to a greater number of books and finally it reduces 
the need for more librarian thereby saving resources for government. To achieve this, research on 
similar project was carried-out and patrons of this system where given a questionnaire to 
understand their need. 



These outlines the functions which this project provides:
1. Book Check-in, checkout, reserve and renew 
2. Make payment: subscription, overdue book, and lost book
3. Add, update patron, librarian and book catalogue details
4. Update password
5. Patron to view borrowing history
6. Search book available in the system
